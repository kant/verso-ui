//  *What is  this?
//  I want to keep the tests and the code they're testing separate.
//  Jest should be allowed for use in the tests ONLY & not in the src folder.
//  ESLint however wants one tsconfig that includes all of the code to be linted.
//  This is a way of providing ESLint with a single tsconfig to work from, while also keeping tests and src separate.
